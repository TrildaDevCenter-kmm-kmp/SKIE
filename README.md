# SKIE

![SKIE](skie-header.jpg)

Skie is a compiler plugin that generates Swift wrappers of the Objective-C headers generated by the Kotlin compiler. Its goal is to improve interoperability between Kotlin and Swift by recreating features supported by both languages, but lost in the translation from Kotlin to Objective-C to Swift.

See [the documentation website](https://skie.touchlab.co/intro) for more info.
