<blockquote>
"SKIE, the open-source tool by Touchlab, has been invaluable for Kotlin Multiplatform development at Mapbox. It provided a perfect solution for seamlessly integrating Kotlin into Swift-based projects. Thanks to SKIE's compile-time magic, we've removed hundreds of lines of boilerplate code, making our codebase cleaner and more maintainable. Remarkably, SKIE continues to perform flawlessly even after modularizing our project and integrating Compose Multiplatform." - Alex Azarov, Senior iOS Engineer at Mapbox
